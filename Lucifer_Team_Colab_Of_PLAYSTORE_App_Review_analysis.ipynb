        "  changes in the play store dataset and after that we do the same with \n",
        "  user review dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **2.** In the case of the play store Dataset,first we deal with the null values \n",
        "  present in every column.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **3.** In the previous, we use the ___isnull()___ and ___sum()___\n",
        "  method to know exactly how many null values present in every column \n",
        "  and we found that there is only 1 null value present in both __'Type'__ \n",
        "  and __'Content Rating'__ column,8 null values present in the __'Current Ver'__ \n",
        "  column,3 null value is in the __'Android Ver'__ column and the highest no of null values (that is 1474) are in the __'Rating'__ column.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **4.** Firstly we deal with the columns having a lesser number of null values\n",
        "  that is __'Type'__ and __'Content Rating'__, so in the Type column we saw that there  is 3 unique values (that is free, paid, and 0), there are 10039 numbers of 'Free'  type,800 number 'Paid' type and only one '0' type but we know that zero is not a type and if we analyze that column only, then we also saw that \n",
        "  in the same row, the __'Rating'__ column has '19.0' as a value, and we know \n",
        "  that is not the right value that means this row is an outlier and also \n",
        "  both __'Content Rating'__ and __'Android Ver'__ have null values so we have to \n",
        "  remove this row permanently.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **5.** So for the type column, the null value will replace with the value 'Free' cause the most number of apps are 'Free' type.  \n",
        "\n",
        "  **6.**  After the __'Type'__ column, we have to deal with the Android ver column, and as we know previously that there are only 3 null values present in the Android Ver column.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **7.** After deeply analyzing that column we find that we can't replace the null values with the ___mean___ or ___median___, and also the outlier row which we find when we analyze the __'Type'__ column also present there so we have to remove all these 3 columns from the dataset.\n",
        "  **8.**  we use the pandas ___drop()___ method for removing these columns and set ___'iplace=True'___ for permanent changes in the data frame.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **9.** Now if we call ___isnull()___ and ___sum()___ methods we can see that only the __'Rating'__ and __'Current Ver'__ columns have null values.\n",

        "\n",
        "  **10.** In the case of the __'Current Ver'__ column we have to remove all the rows containing null values cause like the __'Android Ver'__ column we can't replace the null value of __'Current Ver'__ with the mean or median.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **11.** After dropping all null values we have only one column which contains the null values that are in The __'Rating'__ column. As we can see there are 1470 numbers  of null values in this column, so we can't just remove these rows cause it's a very huge amount of data. so we have to replace these data with the mean of the column.\n",
        " **12.** Without including NaN values, the mean of __'Ratings'__ column is calculated to be 4.2.\n",
        "\n",
        " **13.**The median of the items in the \"Rating\" column  is 4.3. This indicates that 50% of the apps have an average rating above 4.3 and the remaining 50% have a rating below 4.3.\n",

        "\n",
        " **15.**The ratings are left biassed, as seen in the distplot representations.\n",
        "We are aware that if a variable is skewed, the values at the extreme ends of the distribution will affect the mean. As a result, the median provides a more accurate depiction of the vast majority of values in the variable.\n",
        "\n",
        " **16.** So, we will use its median to impute the NaN values in the Rating column.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **17.** For finding the median of the column we use the **median()** function with nonnull values of that column.After finding the median we replace all the null values with the median.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **18.** After these operations we can see there is no null value present in the data frame and we got 10830 rows and 13 columns.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **19.** After null values, we have to work on the ___dtype___ of all columns, so as we have seen previously that there are some columns (like Reviews, Size, Installs, Price, and Last updated) which needs some changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **20.** Firstly for the __'Reviews'__ column, we know that it contains numeric type data so we have to change the ___dtype___ of this column .for changing _dtype_ we use ___astype()___ method. \n",
        "\n",
        "  **21.** After the __'Reviews'__ column, we find that the __'Size'__ column consists of data in __mb__ and __kb__ format __(m for mb and k for kb)__ so we have to remove the __'m'__ and __'k'__ sign from the data and convert the data to mb if it is in kb. for that we write a function that takes the data of the __'Size'__ column as an argument and returns the data without __'m'__ and __'k'__ signs.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **22.** After writing the function we pass the __'Size'__ column \n",
        "  inside the __lambda__ function with the help of ___apply()___ method and stored the new\n",
        "  value in place of old values.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **23.** After this operation, if we call the __head()__ method \n",
        "  and we can see that the __'Size'__ column contains the new value without __'m'__ and __'k'__ sign and all the kb data is converted into mb.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **24.** Like size column __'Install'__ column have some \n",
        "  special symbols like __'+'__ and __','__, so for removing that symbol and converting the __dtype__ we write a function named ___replace___ which takes the data of the __'Install'__ column as an argument and returns the same data without __'+'__ and __','__ symbol and __int__ \n",
        "  type. like __'Size'__, we pass the __'Install'__ column inside the __lambda__ function using ___apply()___ method and got the column updated .\n",
        "\n",
        "  **25.** Now if we call the ___info()___ method we can see \n",
        "  that the values in the __'Install'__ column got updated and the ___dtype___ is also changed.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **26.** After the __'Size'__ and __'Install'__ column it's time for the __'Price'__ column, so for the __'Price'__ column ,first we check how many rows there ,which have some price, and then we found\n",
        "  that there is __797__ row that has some price, not __0__, and also one more thing we found that all these data contain a __Dollar__ symbol in it so we have to remove the __Dollar__ symbol for changing the ___dtype___. for that, we write  a function named ___'remove_dollar'___ which takes the values of the __'Price'__ column as an argument and return the same value with __float__ type and without ___'$'___ symbol.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **27.** Like __'Size'__ and __'Install'__ we use ___apply ()___ method and __lambda__ function to do this operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **28.**  At last, We changed the type of the __'Last Updated'__ column from object to \n",

        "\n",
        "  **29.**Now if we call the ___info()___ method then we can see that all the columns mention above is updated with its ___dtype___ and values\n",

        "### __For User Review Data__\n",
        "    \n",
        "**1.** In the case of the ___user review___ data set, we know that there are many null values present in every column except the __'App'__ column.\n",
